# Exercise 1.7
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, 
# and Bitcoin trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.
# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:
# Exercise 1.8 - 1.9
# Modify the program so that extra payment information can be more generally handled. 
# Make it so that the user can set the extra payment variables
# Exercise 1.10
# Modify the program to print out a table showing the month, total paid so far, and the remaining principal.
